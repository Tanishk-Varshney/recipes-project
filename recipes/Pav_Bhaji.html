    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>I made this after trying different methods over a few years. It all came together so well. The flavor and texture was amazing. You really need to add water at the end and not be scared that it will ruin the dish, it will not! You need a fairly runny consistency for the best pav bhaji. Garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh cilantro if desired. Serve with toasted white bread or bread rolls.</p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoon oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pav bhaji masala, divided</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 small potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canned sweet corn, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mild chile powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more to taste</li>
   </ul>
   <h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step - </strong>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt; fry until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 4 minutes. Pour in 1 cup water. Add 1 teaspoon pav bhaji masala and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step - </strong>Add tomatoes, potatoes, and corn to the saucepan. Season with chile powder, coriander, and ginger. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Mash curry gently with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. Simmer for 10 minutes more. Taste and adjust salt. Add 1/2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala and lemon juice. Mash slightly again.</li>
        <li><strong>Step - </strong>Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to give curry a runny consistency. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and butter; stir until butter is melted. Divide into serving bowls and sprinkle remaining pav bhaji masala on top.</li>
